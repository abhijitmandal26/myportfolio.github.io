#### Projects

Would like to share some of the projects that I completed, most of these are my academic projects which I completed as part of my Masters in Data Science course.

1. **Breast Cancer Identification** [Link to GitHub Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc520/tree/master/FinalProject)
<br/><br/>The intent of this project is to assist doctors in diagnosing breast cancer for patients, allowing physicians to spend more time on treating the disease. Using machine learning methods for diagnostic can significantly increase processing speed and on a big scale can make the diagnostic significantly cheaper.

2. **Inventory Management** [Link to GitHub Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc530)
<br/><br/>The intent of this project is to help retail firms in effectively managing their inventory using an ML model built from historic sales data. A retail firm has many products in their inventory, and very few of them tend to sell (only about 10% sell each year) and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year

3. **Covid 19 Data Analysis and Comparison** [Link to GitHub Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc540/tree/main/FinalProject)
<br/><br/>The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious respiratory virus that first reported in Wuhan, China. On 2/11/2020, the World Health Organization designated the name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. This new strain of virus has strike fear in many countries as cities are quarantined and hospitals are overcrowded. This project aims at exploring COVID-19 through data analysis and visualization.

4. **Simplifying Microsoft’s royalty ecosystem with connected data service** [Link to Project Summary](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/simplifying-microsofts-royalty-ecosystem-with-connected-data-service/)
<br/><br/>This project is about RaaS (Royalties Assurance as a Service), Which is a relatively new capability on the Microsoft Royalties team. As the internal experts on the query tool, engineers are RaaS’ primary frontline users, handling queries for the rest of the royalties business to help validate their data. We have reduced that complexity through building a fully connected data system to bring it to a single canvas that is easy to interact with. With RaaS, our Royalties team was able to do just that with the help of RaaS APIs that enable system-to-system integration—including Microsoft Teams integration—and human augmented exploratory analytics.

8. **Movie Recommendation System** 
<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to provide a recommendation system for video content providers to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies.
<br/>Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are related to the search history of the user.
<br/>They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other. Major companies like YouTube, Amazon, Netflix use recommendation systems in social and e- commerce sites use recommendation system for its users to suggest for an individual according to their requirement more precise and accurate. These online content and service providers have a huge amount of content so the problem which arises is which data is required for whom so the problem of providing apposite content frequently. This project represents the overview and approaches of techniques generated in a recommendation system.

#### Articles and Blog Posts
I am a casual blogger, usually post something which is really interesting and cutting edge and may help others in understanting the space better.

1. Migrating to MicroServices [Link to Article](https://dzone.com/articles/migrating-to-microservices)

  - This article details the steps to migrate an existing monolithic application to microservices, an architectural approach that consists of building systems from small services, each in their own process, communicating over lightweight protocols. This will provide a broad view of microservices implementation in Azure using service fabric, challenges faced in migration, approaches, and strategies that we can implement, and ways to build, release, monitor, and scale microservices.
   
2. Managing Queue Messaging using Rabbit MQ Client [Link to Article](https://dzone.com/articles/managing-queue-messages-using-rabbitmq-client)

 - This Article is about maintaining queues and deadletters for RabbitMQ
