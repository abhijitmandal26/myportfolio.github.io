I am a software professional with 20+ years of experience in IT Industry with strong Architectural, Management and hands on development skills. I have a portfolio of successfully delivering IT Application Development projects. I have a great passion for designing software architecture and optimized solutions by following the latest industry standards. 

  I have spent a sizable amount of time in Architecting Cloud based applications in Azure cloud PaaS/ IaaS/ SaaS, CI/CD, migrating on-premise applications to Azure, experience in all azure areas like Networking (Cloud/hybrid), Compute, Storage, messaging, Azure Services, Security, CI/CD, DevOps, implementation of cloud design patterns, applying ML techniques in anomaly detection and other areas.

  I am a certified PMP and have 5+ years of Project Management experience in handling small to mid-size projects (>$2 million), with experience in Pre-sales, RFP, preparing business growth strategies, migration plans, creating and handling geographically located teams, monitoring utilization, productivity, costs and project management. Used Agile/Scrum and Waterfall methodologies. I have experience in managing teams with >35 resources across different geographies.

#### Projects

Would like to share some of the projects that I completed, most of these are my academic projects which I completed as part of my Masters in Data Science course.

1. **Breast Cancer Identification** [Link to GitHub Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc520/tree/master/FinalProject)
<br/><br/>The intent of this project is to assist doctors in diagnosing breast cancer for patients, allowing physicians to spend more time on treating the disease. Using machine learning methods for diagnostic can significantly increase processing speed and on a big scale can make the diagnostic significantly cheaper.

2. **Inventory Management** [Link to GitHub Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc530)
<br/><br/>The intent of this project is to help retail firms in effectively managing their inventory using an ML model built from historic sales data. A retail firm has many products in their inventory, and very few of them tend to sell (only about 10% sell each year) and many of the products only have a single sale in the course of a year

3. **Covid 19 Data Analysis and Comparison** [Link to GitHub Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc540/tree/main/FinalProject)
<br/><br/>The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious respiratory virus that first reported in Wuhan, China. On 2/11/2020, the World Health Organization designated the name COVID-19 for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. This new strain of virus has strike fear in many countries as cities are quarantined and hospitals are overcrowded. This project aims at exploring COVID-19 through data analysis and visualization.

4. **Simplifying Microsoft’s royalty ecosystem with connected data service** [Link to Project Summary](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/simplifying-microsofts-royalty-ecosystem-with-connected-data-service/)
<br/><br/>This project is about RaaS (Royalties Assurance as a Service), Which is a relatively new capability on the Microsoft Royalties team. As the internal experts on the query tool, engineers are RaaS’ primary frontline users, handling queries for the rest of the royalties business to help validate their data. We have reduced that complexity through building a fully connected data system to bring it to a single canvas that is easy to interact with. With RaaS, our Royalties team was able to do just that with the help of RaaS APIs that enable system-to-system integration—including Microsoft Teams integration—and human augmented exploratory analytics.

5. **House Price Prediction** [Link to Github Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc550)
<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model for the prediction of housing prices based on pattern extracted from our USA_Housing dataset which contains data about USA housing sales provided by Kaggle. This dataset contains features like number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, sqft, year built, year renovated, condition, zipcode and the target variable will be price. We will use various visualization methods to analyze the correlation of each feature as part of EDA. Descriptive analysis and quantitative analysis will use subsets of it depending on models. This project consists of two phases: - 
  - Phase I: Focuses on data cleaning, exploration and preprocessing.
  - Phase II : Machine Learning model building, validation and prediction.
 
6. **Credit Card Fraud Detection** [Link to Github Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/dsc630)
The goal of this project is to define a fraud montoring model to help banks to automate the Credit Card eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form & Credit history of customer.
The decision of approving a credit card or loan is majorly dependent on the personal and financial background of the applicant. Factors like, age, gender, income, employment status, credit history and other attributes all carry weight in the approval decision. Credit analysis involves the measure to investigate the probability of a third-party to pay back the loan to the bank on time and predict its default characteristic. Analysis focus on recognizing, assessing, and reducing the financial or other risks that could lead to loss involved in the transaction.

7. **Movie Recommendation System** [Link to Github Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/DSC680/tree/main/Project1)
<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to provide a recommendation system for video content providers to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies.
<br/>Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are related to the search history of the user.
<br/>They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other. Major companies like YouTube, Amazon, Netflix use recommendation systems in social and e- commerce sites use recommendation system for its users to suggest for an individual according to their requirement more precise and accurate. These online content and service providers have a huge amount of content so the problem which arises is which data is required for whom so the problem of providing apposite content frequently. This project represents the overview and approaches of techniques generated in a recommendation system.

8. **Sentiment Analysis** [Link to Github Code Repository](https://github.com/abhijitmandal26/DSC680/blob/main/Project2/Readme.md)
<br/><br/>This project will focus on performing a sentiment analysis on some tweets in Twitter which will be chosen as the project progresses. The main goal of this analysis is to discover the underlying sentiment from a users tweet. 
<br/>The opinions that are mined will be classified into two categories positive and negative. 
<br/>An analysis will then be performed on the classified data to see what percentage of the population sample fall into each category.


9. **Upcoming Project 1** 

10. **Upcoming Project 2** 

#### Articles and Blog Posts
I am a casual blogger, usually post something which is really interesting and cutting edge and may help others in understanting the space better.

1. Migrating to MicroServices [Link to Article](https://dzone.com/articles/migrating-to-microservices)

  - This article details the steps to migrate an existing monolithic application to microservices, an architectural approach that consists of building systems from small services, each in their own process, communicating over lightweight protocols. This will provide a broad view of microservices implementation in Azure using service fabric, challenges faced in migration, approaches, and strategies that we can implement, and ways to build, release, monitor, and scale microservices.
